            <h3 id="headline">Timeline of Alan Turing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jun 23,1912 -</strong> Born as <b>Alan Mathison Turing</b> in Maide Vale, London</li>
                <li><strong>Jan 1,1922 -</strong> Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School</li>
                <li><strong>Aug 19, 1926 -</strong> Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential which
                    was noticed at the Sherborne School.</li>
                <li><strong>Aug 29, 1931 -</strong> Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in
                    Cambridge.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sep 30, 1936 -</strong> Studied Mathematics and Cryptology at Princeton University.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dec 6, 1939 -</strong> Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval
                    indicator system, Hut 8 and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mar 18, 1940 -</strong> Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a
                    cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sep 13, 1947 -</strong> Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the
                    ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Aug 31, 1948 -</strong> Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the
                    University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program
                    computers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Apr 29, 1950 -</strong> The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to
                    compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Jun 8, 1954 -</strong>Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him
                    dead.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    “Finding such a person makes everyone else appear so ordinary…and if anything happens to him, you’ve
                    got nothing left but to return to the ordinary world, and a kind of isolation that never existed
                    before.”
